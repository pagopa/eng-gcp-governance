## GCP docs

[Google Cloud docs](https://cloud.google.com/docs)
[GCP Organization policy docs](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/creating-managing-policies)

## Policy evaluation

GCP policies are evaluated in real time when a resource is created or modified.

## Terraform lock.hcl

We have both developers who work with your Terraform configuration on their Linux, macOS or Windows workstations and automated systems that apply the configuration while running on Linux.
<https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/providers/lock.html#specifying-target-platforms>

So we need to specify this in terraform lock providers:

```sh
terraform init

rm .terraform.lock.hcl

terraform providers lock \
  -platform=windows_amd64 \
  -platform=darwin_amd64 \
  -platform=darwin_arm64 \
  -platform=linux_amd64
```
